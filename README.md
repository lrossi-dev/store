# lrossi.store

This is a simple, small microsservices project I'm working on in order to not get rusty when it comes to the Spring-verse (since I've been working only with Vert.x and Quarkus for the past few months).

## What do I plan on studying here?

I want for the project to cover at least the following topics:

* SpringWeb: sincronous REST controllers for the sake of my mental health;
* Spring Data (JPA, JDBC): haven't been working with a database for ages now;
* Microsservices integration utils: I really want to abuse things like Feign and Histrix;
* Messaging: sometimes I do what want, sometimes I do what I must;

If you have ANY doubts about the project or the technologies used, please feel free to check out the [Spring Framework Docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/index.html) since I'll probably be busy debugging some proxy classes for the next few weeks.
